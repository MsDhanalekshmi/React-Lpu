Create a Tabs component that accepts a tabs prop, which is an array of objects with title and content properties.
The component should render a list of clickable tabs with the title of each object.
When a tab is clicked, the corresponding content should be displayed below the list of tabs.
OUTPUT:
.Tab 1


Assume this data for tabs = [{title:”Tab 1”, content: “This is the content forTab 1”}, {title:”Tab 2”, content: “Tab 2”},{title:”Tab 3”, content: “Tab 3”}]
